Description:
The chat system is designed to be synchronous one message
after another. It was built on the OSU engineering servers
while running the client and server on seperate windows. As
such the host information passed to the client runs through
the gethostbyname() function and is passed the string
local host.

The backslash '\' character is reserved for termination.
Upon user input of '\quit' the program signals the connected
process to also quit by sending it a message punctuated by
the backslash.

The asterisk '*' character is the only completely off limits
character. It is used as a unique end of transmission character
in recv() while loops.



To Run:
The bash script "run_client" will compile and start the client
for you on one end. You will pass it a client username,
server host (in this case "localhost"), and the server port.
The bash script run_server" will execute the python server.
You will pass it the server username and the port to run on.



Example:

(On Server)
$run_server wilsonk 57771

(On Client)
&run_client derringa localhost 57771
